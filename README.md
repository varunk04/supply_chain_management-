# supply_chain_management-

## Scenario: 
A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a miss match in the demand and supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss in inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.

## Goal & Objective: 
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will determine the optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time from the respective warehouse.
